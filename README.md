### Hi there, it's Saman speaking 👋

#### I know myself as a junior Android developer

- 😆 I'm 20 and already have 4+ years of professional Android development
- 🤩 I'm currently working on a crypto market data app (which I handle server side as well)
- 🤖 One of my main passions and strengths is UI designing. I think that it's a very subtle art
- 🥰 I love working with `.kt` and `.java` and `.xml` files (Especially Kotlin 💯)
- 🤔 I'm planning to learn Robot framework and Automated Testing as soon as I finish my current projects
- 🤠 I like to travel all around the world :) (well as soon as I have free time😩)
- 🎃 You can look at some of my old works on <a href="https://dribbble.com/samansamadi">Dribbble</a>
- ✉️ Feel free to ask me anything (Suggestions, criticism, etc) throughout my email :) => saman.samady67@outlook.com
- 🤝 I don't have so much contributions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/9612643/saman">Stackoverflow</a> but you are free to check my profile

#### 2022 is gonna be good for me. I know it 👁
