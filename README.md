### Hi there, it's Saman speaking 👋

- One of my main passions and strengths is UI designing. I think that it's a very subtle art
- I love working with `.kt` and `.java` and `.xml` files (Especially Kotlin 💯)
-  You can look at some of my old works on <a href="https://dribbble.com/samansamadi">Dribbble</a>
- Feel free to ask me anything (Suggestions, criticism, etc) throughout my email :) => saman.samady67@outlook.com
-  I don't have so much contributions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/9612643/saman">Stackoverflow</a> but you are free to check my profile

## RoadMap
- Learning automated testing and robot framework
- Dive deep into app security in Android
- Mastering Jetpack Compose
